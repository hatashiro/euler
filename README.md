# One day, one Haskell

![Hello World in Haskell](http://i.imgur.com/xi5Sroz.png)

Not sure where it goes, hopefully to the world of FP.

## The story

I love FP, and also love studying FP. Haskell has always been a language I like
to learn. However, Haskell is not easy. I've tried to learn it several times,
and have always failed. This repository shall be the last and complete try.

## The path

I'll upload at least 1 commit a day to this repository. I'm not really sure
what this project will become, and in fact I don't really care, as the object
is to learn the awesome langauge, not to create an awesome stuff. Surely I'll
try to create something useful though.

## Hello, comrades!

As it's open source, any contribution will be welcomed including pointing a
path where I should follow, reviewing my work, etc.

Also, it's completely up to you to fork this project and modify whatever you
want to, and even monetise it, if possible.

## Inspiration

This project is strongly inspired by
