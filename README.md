> A Haskell adventure into Project Euler

## Progress

![Project Euler Profile](https://projecteuler.net/profile/noraesae.png)

## The story

I love FP, and also love studying FP. Haskell has always been a language I like
to learn. However, Haskell is not easy. I've tried to learn it several times,
and have always failed. This repository shall be the last and complete try.

## The path

I'll try to solve at least 1 problem a day. It may be hard as I will sometimes
be busy at others, or sometimes the problem is just too hard to solve in a
short time. Anyway I'll try, and will upload a solution, or at least a progress,
everyday. I believe it leads me to a way learning Haskell in a right and joyful
manner.

## Hello, comrades!

My friend key is `328871_fae510bf049aa8aa2ebd7bf6cdc52e1b`.

I also want to meet some friends solving Euler, so please feel free to drop a
friend key in [Issues](https://github.com/noraesae/euler/issues).
